### Hi There!

NextUrban initially bridges the gap between the understanding of neighborhood satisfaction         
and conventional planning decision-making practices. A social media outlet has been tested to            
evaluate the potential of online review mining in planning practices. The applicable results are         
presented in the following repository providing the necessary introductions.         

Ultimatly, the mission is to augment the planning performance management in smartcities through a rapid planning             
communication framework. 🏡 📲 🌏
